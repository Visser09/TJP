{"Start with micros (e.g., MES/MNQ/M2K/MGC); 1 contract until expectancy is proven.","Journal template per trade: date/time, instrument, setup tag, thesis, entry/stop/target, size, risk (R), result (R), MFE/MAE, hold time, slippage, adherence score (0–1), screenshot.","Weekly review: promote top 1–2 setups by expectancy; pause or refine bottom setups; write one rule change max per week.","Backtest 3 core setups on last 3 months; forward-test 20 trades each in sim, then 20 live micros.","Automate risk: platform daily loss lock, max position cap, OCO orders by default, news filter alerts.","Prop firm checklist: trade ≥5 days, avoid outsized single-day gains, stay flat into restricted times, and document rule compliance per day."}

Pattern Recognition
{"Time-of-day edge: compare first 60 minutes vs midday vs late session performance.","Day-type filter: trend vs range; use ATR or opening range break to classify and tag results by regime.","Instrument-specific: evaluate ES vs NQ vs CL/MGC micros for volatility vs slippage trade-offs.","Execution errors to flag: chasing after missed move, moving stops, adding to losers, revenge trading after -2R days.","Consistency risk: single-day PnL > 40% of total over the period can fail prop 'consistency' rules—aim for smoother distribution."}

Risk Assessment
{"Per-trade risk: 0.25–0.5% of account or 10–20% of the daily drawdown limit (use smaller of the two).","Daily stop: min(1.5R, 40% of daily DD); stop trading immediately when hit.","Session guardrails: max 3–5 trades/day; after 2 consecutive losses, pause or stop for the day.","Use hard brackets on entry (OCO): predefined stop and target; target R:R ≥ 1:1.5.","Scale only after 4–5 green days with peak-to-trough DD < 0.5× daily DD; increase size by 1 contract at a time.","News risk: flat 3–5 minutes before/after high-impact releases (CPI, FOMC, NFP) to avoid slippage and rule violations.","Prop firm alignment: never breach daily/trailing DD; avoid overnight holds unless rules allow; respect max position limits."}
